          <div class="prose">
            <p>I started this practice to bring enterprise engineering rigor to mid-market companies that need AI and technical leadership but can't justify a full-time CTO. Since 2020, I've served as fractional CTO or AI advisor to more than a dozen companies across fintech, investment banking, pharma, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, hospitality, government, and education.</p>
            <p>Current engagements include: Head of AI for an auto loan refinancing fintech. Fractional CTO and AI Advisor for a Denver-based middle-market investment bank. AI Advisor to senior architects and engineers on voice agent and agentic AI initiatives at a software development firm. Head of AI for a performance consulting firm serving Amazon, Sanofi, J&amp;J, Pfizer, and other Fortune 500 clients.</p>
            <p>Past engagements include fractional CTO roles where my technology guidance contributed to a successful acquisition, AI advisory for a DOE-funded cleantech company developing gravity battery storage, computer vision product development for advanced manufacturing, generative AI product design for healthcare, and AI strategy for offshore engineering talent platforms.</p>

          <h3>Colorado School of Mines</h3>
          <div class="timeline__period">AI Advisory Board &amp; Entrepreneur in Residence — 2022 to Present</div>
          <div class="prose">
            <p>I serve on the AI Program Advisory Board for the Business and Economics Department, providing curriculum guidance and guest lecturing in graduate programs including the capstone. I shape how the next generation of engineering and technology leaders learns to evaluate, deploy, and govern AI systems.</p>
            <p>Prior to the advisory board role, I spent three years as Entrepreneur in Residence at the Beck Venture Center, supporting faculty and alumni in commercializing advanced technology companies. That work included the West Gate Program, a partnership with the National Renewable Energy Lab and the Department of Energy to accelerate clean energy commercialization.</p>

          <div class="prose">
            <p>This is where I learned to build and operate at enterprise scale. I led the full lifecycle of technology strategy, product design, delivery, quality control, production operations, and security for large IoT, SaaS, and quantitative ML systems in the energy industry.</p>
            <p>I managed a $2M+ monthly run rate with multiple quarters exceeding 50% profit margin. Scaled staff and delivery processes by 700%, recruiting and evaluating more than 100 technical directors, architects, data scientists, and engineers.</p>
            <p>The technical systems I designed and directed processed billions of rows of data across 30M+ end customers with hundreds of automated data pipelines running nightly. I reduced ML modeling timeframes from months to days and cut modeling costs by 90% by integrating AI teams and processes into the core engineering stack.</p>
            <p>Responsible for all cloud operations and IT security in Azure and AWS: threat management, networking, data security, disaster recovery, intrusion detection, and penetration testing.</p>

        <h3>Technical depth</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>My technical leadership spans AI agent architectures, large language model integration, computer vision (including production YOLO deployments), custom ML model development, generative AI pipeline design, data pipeline engineering at billions-of-rows scale, cloud infrastructure (AWS and Azure), and security practices from threat management through penetration testing.</p>
          <p>I maintain architectural fluency across the full stack. I evaluate vendors, review architecture, direct development teams, and debug production issues. When I tell a client something will or won't work, it's because I've led teams that built the thing, not because I read a whitepaper about it.</p>

          <p>Fintech and payments (auto lending, credit card processing, distributed financial systems). Investment banking (middle-market M&amp;A advisory, deal technology, due diligence). Pharma and healthcare (AI products for Sanofi, J&amp;J, Pfizer, AstraZeneca through consulting engagements; healthcare AI product design). Energy and utilities (IoT, smart grid, gravity battery storage, DOE research programs). Manufacturing (computer vision for quality assurance). Hospitality (AI voice agent strategy for restaurant chains; technology strategy contributing to a hospitality SaaS acquisition). Government (federal software solutions). Higher education (curriculum development, startup incubation, AI strategy).</p>
          <p>The common thread: complex operations where AI and data systems can automate high-volume processes, improve decision quality, or create capabilities that weren't previously possible.</p>

        <h3>How I work</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>I keep my client roster small. I currently serve a handful of companies at a time, which means each one gets sustained attention rather than drive-by consulting. I'm based in Golden, Colorado, and work with clients nationally.</p>
          <p>I'm direct. If your AI project is a bad idea, I'll say so. If the right answer is "don't build this," you'll hear that in our first conversation. My job is to protect your time and capital, not to generate billable hours.</p>

        Every engagement is different. The constant: I stay close to the work. I don't hand you a strategy deck and disappear. I lead the execution, make the technical calls, and stay accountable for outcomes.

  <div class="container">
    <div class="track">
      <div class="track__header reveal">
        <span class="section-label">Track 01</span>
        <h2>Advisory &amp; Fractional Leadership</h2>
        <p>Senior AI and technical leadership for companies that need strategic direction without a full-time executive hire. I embed with your leadership team and operate as your CTO or Head of AI.</p>

          <p>I join your leadership team on a part-time, ongoing basis. I set technical direction, evaluate build-vs-buy decisions, hire and manage engineering talent, and represent technology to your board and investors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>AI Strategy &amp; Readiness Assessment</h3>

        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Executive &amp; Team AI Enablement</h3>
          <p>Training programs designed for your actual roles and workflows. Not generic AI overviews. I design custom curricula starting with engineering teams and expanding to operations, sales, and leadership.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Technical Due Diligence</h3>
          <p>For private equity firms and investment banks evaluating acquisitions. I assess technical infrastructure, AI capabilities, engineering team quality, and technology risk. Delivered as a structured diligence report.</p>

          <h3>AI Agent Development</h3>

        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Software Product Engineering</h3>
          <p>Data products, internal tools, and customer-facing applications. I lead architecture decisions, technology selection, team assembly, and delivery management from concept through launch.</p>

        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Data Infrastructure &amp; Pipelines</h3>
          <p>The foundation that makes AI work. I design data pipelines that scale to billions of rows, establish proper data governance, and direct the engineering teams that build the infrastructure your AI systems depend on.</p>

        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Cloud Architecture &amp; Migration</h3>
          <p>Right-sized cloud infrastructure on AWS or Azure. I design for cost efficiency from the start and lead migration efforts, avoiding the common trap of over-provisioned environments that drain budget without delivering value.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">

        <h2 class="mb-md">What AI agents do for your business</h2>
        <p class="text-large mb-3xl">AI agents are software systems that take action on your behalf. They don't just answer questions. They read documents, query databases, make decisions, trigger workflows, and interact with customers and employees. They operate continuously, handle volume that would require large teams, and improve over time.</p>

          <div class="agent-card__icon">⟿</div>
          <h3>Workflow Automation</h3>
          <p>Agents that execute multi-step business processes: intake and routing, document processing, approval workflows, data extraction and entry, report generation. They handle the repetitive operational work that consumes your team's time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="agent-card reveal">
          <div class="agent-card__icon">◉</div>
          <h3>Customer Interaction</h3>
          <p>Voice and text agents that handle customer inquiries, schedule appointments, process requests, and escalate to humans when needed. These aren't chatbots reading a script. They understand context, access your systems, and resolve issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="agent-card reveal">
          <div class="agent-card__icon">⊞</div>
          <h3>Data Retrieval &amp; Analysis</h3>
          <p>Agents that query across your databases, documents, and APIs to answer complex questions, generate insights, and surface information that would take a human analyst hours to compile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="agent-card reveal">

          <h3>Decision Support</h3>
          <p>Agents that evaluate options, score risks, recommend actions, and prepare analysis for human decision-makers. They augment your team's judgment with consistent, data-grounded analysis at speed.</p>

  <!-- The Gap -->
  <section class="section--flush-top">
    <div class="container--860">
      <div class="reveal">
        <span class="section-label">The Problem</span>
        <h2 class="mb-md">Why most AI initiatives fail</h2>
        <p class="mb-3xl">The connecting thread across all five: each one is an organizational failure, not a technical one. The technology works well enough for most business applications today. What fails is the translation layer between what the technology can do and how the organization actually operates, decides, and changes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__card reveal">
        <h3>1. No defined business problem — solution looking for a use case</h3>
        <p>Most failed initiatives start with "we should use AI for something" rather than "this specific workflow costs us $X, takes Y hours, and produces Z errors." Without a measurable baseline and a clear target state, teams build demos that impress in a conference room but never survive contact with production data, edge cases, or actual users. The excitement of the technology substitutes for the discipline of problem definition.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__card reveal">
        <h3>2. Data readiness is assumed, not verified</h3>
        <p>Organizations chronically overestimate the quality, accessibility, and structure of their data. Generative AI compounds this because it requires not just clean transactional data but contextual, unstructured, and often cross-system data that has never been governed. Teams discover 8 weeks into a project that the knowledge base is stale, the CRM has duplicate records at a 30% rate, or critical institutional knowledge lives in individual email inboxes. Data remediation then consumes the budget originally allocated for the AI work itself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__card reveal">
        <h3>3. Enablement treats AI as a tool rollout, not a capability shift</h3>
        <p>The most common enablement failure pattern: buy licenses, run a 90-minute training, send a Slack message, declare victory. Adoption craters within weeks. Generative AI requires people to change how they frame problems, evaluate outputs, and structure their work. That is behavior change, not tool adoption. Without role-specific use cases, guided practice, feedback loops, and visible leadership modeling, most employees default to prior workflows. The gap between "I've seen a demo" and "I use this daily to make better decisions faster" is where most enablement programs die.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__card reveal">
        <h3>4. No governance model for accuracy, risk, and iteration</h3>
        <p>Generative AI outputs are probabilistic. Organizations that lack a clear framework for who reviews outputs, what error rates are acceptable, how hallucinations are caught, and where human judgment remains mandatory will either over-trust the system (creating liability) or under-trust it (killing adoption). This is especially acute in regulated industries, but it applies everywhere. The absence of a lightweight governance structure means every individual user is making their own risk decisions, which is unsustainable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__card reveal">
        <h3>5. Executive sponsorship without executive understanding</h3>
        <p>A common pattern: a senior leader sponsors an AI initiative but delegates all decisions to a technical team, an innovation group, or a vendor. When the project requires changes to workflows, headcount allocation, cross-departmental data sharing, or risk tolerance decisions, the sponsor lacks the context to make those calls quickly. Decisions stall. The technical team builds what they can in isolation. The result is technically functional but organizationally orphaned — no one owns integration into actual business processes. The inverse is equally damaging: executives who mandate specific AI tools or timelines without understanding the underlying constraints around data, privacy, or model limitations.</p>

  <!-- Why Managed Matters -->

        <span class="section-label">Managed AI Services</span>
        <h2 class="mb-md">Why "build and hand off" fails</h2>
        <p class="text-large mb-3xl">AI systems are not traditional software. They degrade. Models drift as real-world conditions change. Foundation model providers update their APIs and pricing without warning. Business rules evolve. Your agents need active management, not just maintenance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="track__grid">
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
          <p>We track every interaction: accuracy rates, response quality, latency, cost per query. You get dashboards and regular reports. When performance drops below thresholds, we act before it becomes a business problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Drift Detection &amp; Retraining</h3>
          <p>Agent accuracy degrades as the world changes. We monitor for drift, maintain evaluation datasets, and retrain or update agents proactively. Your agents stay accurate without requiring your attention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Cost Control</h3>
          <p>AI compute costs compound. We optimize prompts, evaluate model alternatives, implement caching strategies, and right-size infrastructure. The goal: maintain or improve quality while reducing cost per interaction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="track__card reveal">
          <h3>Incident Response</h3>
          <p>Defined SLAs with clear escalation paths. When an agent behaves unexpectedly or a dependency breaks, we respond. You get transparent post-incident reporting and permanent fixes, not temporary patches.</p>
